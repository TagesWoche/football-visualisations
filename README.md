## Football visualisations based on Google Docs API

To use this, you need our node.js server app, see other repo.

So far, we have created three visualisations based on the API ourselves. We strongly encourage you to check out the data yourself and see what you can do with it.
If you build anything with out data, please let us know, we might want to embed it to our site.

### Goal scene analysis
All goals that FCB scores or concedes are mapped on a virtual football field based on the chess-like notation in the spreadsheet. The user can follow the path of the ball and see, which players were involved where. We distinguish passes, dribbles and shots. For shots, we record which foot was used (or head) and where in the goal it hit.

### Interactive stats table
All player-related data is compiled into an interactive table.
Three views are provided: overview, ratings, goals
All views come with filters for season, competion, home/away
All columns can be sorted

### Scorecards
see separate repo
